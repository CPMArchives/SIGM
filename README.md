# SIGM
The Special Interest Group/Microcomputers was a users' group dedicated to 8-bit computing in the late 1970s to mid-80s, which distributed primarily CP/M software on floppy disks. It's software library eventually became one of the most important of the era.

Versions of the SIG/M library are still available from a number of sources on the Internet, subject, however, to a large number of accretions and corruptions, and none of the collections is complete. This project, therefore, aims to recreate as closely and cleanly as possible an "original" version of the library, with as many of the various accretions, omissions and corruptions fixed as possible.

The initial version of this script will create a series of directories, e.g./ vol001/, vol002, etc. with the contents of each volume, as well as .ARK and .LBR CP/M archives and .DSK files, which are IBM-3740-format disk images intended for use in CP/M emulators.

To run this script, first read its comments for details, then copy to your system. Download the ISO images listed, and make sure you have all the required utilities installed, then edit the script variables in the VARIABLES section.
