# SIGM
The Special Interest Group/Microcomputers was a users' group dedicated to 8-bit computing in the late 1970s to mid-80s, which distributed primarily CP/M software on floppy disks. It's software library eventually became one of the most important of the era.

Versions of the SIG/M library are still available from a number of sources on the Internet, subject, however, to a large number of accretions and corruptions, and none of the collections is complete. This project, therefore, aims to recreate as closely and cleanly as possible an "original" version of the library, with as many of the various accretions, omissions and corruptions fixed as possible.
