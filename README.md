# SIGM
### PREFACE

The **Special Interest Group/Microcomputers** is a still-active users' group of the **_Amateur Computer Club_ of New Jersey**. Originally formed in the late 1970s, through 1986 it frequently released software distribution disks of software dedicated to 8-bit computing, primparily under the **CP/M** operating system and its later derivatives. Its software library eventually became one of the most important of the era.

Versions of the SIG/M library are still available from a number of sources on the Internet, subject, however, to a large number of accretions and corruptions, and none of the collections is complete (nearly all, for example, omit volumes 184-192). This project, therefore, aims to recreate as closely and cleanly as possible an "original" version of the library, with as many of the various accretions, omissions and corruptions fixed as possible.

The initial version of this script creates a series of directories, vol001/, vol002, etc. with the contents of each volume, as well as .ARK and .LBR CP/M archives and .DSK files, which are IBM-3740-format disk images intended for use in **CP/M** emulators.

### USAGE

To run this script, first read its comments for details, then copy **buildvol** to your system. Download the ISO images listed, and make sure you have all the required utilities installed, then edit the script variables in the VARIABLES section. To build a volume, specify a volume number:
```
buildvol 228
```
To build the entire collection:
```
for i in {1..310}; do buildvol $i; done
```
