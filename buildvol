# This is a script to build a clean set of SIG/M volumes from available sources.
  
# --------
# VERSIONS
# --------
#   The latest version of this script is available at https://github.com/CPMArchives/SIGM.
#
#   2022-05-06 - A major rewrite of several portions:
#              - A major rewrite of the copyfiles function, allowing the caller to optionally
#                specify a list of files to be copied from the source.
#              - Changes to the build of several volumes (59, 60, 80, 84, 85, 87, 93, 105,
#                172, 291, 292) to clean up CRC mismatches.
#              - Other minor changes and bug fixes.
#
#   2022-04-14 - I've forgotten to track changes. See the github site above if you're interested.
#
#   2022-04-06 - Set date of ARK, LBR, DSK dirs to release date of vol 310.
#   
#   2022-04-05 - Initial release.

# -----
# USAGE
# -----

#   Place this script somewhere on your system. Read these comments for details. Download the ISO images and make sure you 
#   have all the required utilities installed (see the REQUIREMENTS section above) and available in your system path. Then 
#   edit two variables in the VARIABLES section: $iso_loc and $buildroot. Or just place the ISOs and this script together 
#   in the current directory. You can now build a single volume; e.g.:

#     ./buildvol 228

#   Or the entire collection (on my system this takes a bit over five minutes):

#     for i in {1..310}; do ./buildvol $i; done

# ------- ----
# PROJECT GOAL
# ------- ----

# While there are several sources currently available for the SIG/M collection, none of them is "clean" or complete. Some
# sources have accreted a number of additional files (cf. Walnut Creek), have corrupted file names (ibid.), and/or have
# stripped CP/M record padding. This clean-up will focus on the following four areas:

# Complete Collection
# -------- ----------
# Individually, none of the sources has all 310 volumes; prominently, volumes 184-192 are missing from most such collections.
# By utilizing all known sources, I have been able to assemble a complete SIG/M collection, including the missing vols 184-192.

# Volume Content
# ------ -------
# Occasionally, files have gone missing from some sources. More commonly, some sources (looking at you, Walnut Creek), have
# accreted additional files. For volume content, -CATALOG and (where available) CRCKFILE are considered canonical. Only files
# listed there are included, with three exceptions: CRCKFILE itself, CRCK.COM and SIG/M.LIB. In early volumes CRCK.COM appears
# only in CRCKFILE; likely it was added after -CATALOG was built. In later volumes when CRCs have moved into -CATALOG CRCK.COM
# and SIG/M.LIB appear only inconsistently, even when they are present in the sources. In those instances, they are retained.

# File Names
# ---- -----
# File names have suffered a number of corruptions. Some characters, such as /, @ and +, which are legal under CP/M, are prob-
# lematic under other file systems, and are often found altered. / is a special problem, which has played havoc in UNIX environ-
# ments (cf. volume 195 on the Walnut Creek CD). It is stored properly as / inside the ARK, LBR and DSK images created here, but
# as _ (underscore) on the host system.

# File Dates
# ---- -----
# The CP/M file system had no capacity for storing file dates, so the original files had none. The decision has been made to
# set dates on individual files to match their volume's release date, but keep in mind that these, too, are artificial.
#
# Exceptions are CRCK.COM (CRC.COM beginning with vol 73) and SIG/M.LIB, which appear in multiple volumes. So long as they remain 
# identical to earlier versions, their dates will be set to the date of their earliest appearance in the SIG/M collection. [Not 
# yet implemented]

# File Integrity
# ---- ---------
# CP/M had no facility for recording exact file sizes, but stored files in 128-byte records. Thus typically a file, unless it
# happened to be exactly some multiple of 128 bytes in length, was padded with a number of "garbage" bytes (commonly 1AH, since
# CP/M filled freshly formatted disks with 1AH which also doubled as an end-of-file marker for text files under CP/M) to the next
# multiple of 128 bytes. However, when the SIG/M collection passed through other OSes text files often lost this padding. Though 
# not detrimental, this resulted in CRCs which no longer match those in -CATALOG or CRCKFILE listings. This project restores the 
# padding to all files that are not an exact multiple of 128 bytes in length, restoring in almost all cases original CRCs.

# ---------
# FUNCTIONS
# ---------

#    SOURCE - Mounts the source specified ("cpmdosgg", "oak", etc.) in preparation to copy the files. Mostly called from COPYFILES.
# COPYFILES - Copies files from the source, uppercasing all filenames. Also corrects a few corrupted names.
# DATEFILES - Sets the file datestamps to the date of release of that volume; in most cases pulls the date from -CATALOG.
#  CHECKCRC - an attempt to automate CRC comparison, but it may be hopelessly messy. Not currently used.
#       CRC - returns the CRC value of a file
#  DISMOUNT - Unmount the source mounted with SOURCE. Mostly called from COPYFILES.
#    RENAME - Renames files.
#       ARK - Creates a VOL###.ARK archive file. Requires cpmtools.
#       DSK - Creates an IBM-3740-format disk image for use in CP/M emulators.
#       LBR - Creates a CP/M-style LBR archive.
#  ARCHIVES - Master routine that calls ARK, DSK and LBR.
#    REMOVE - Deletes files.                       
#       PAD - Pads file lengths with 1AH out to 128-byte multiples.
#   PADNULL - Same as PAD, but pads with 00H instead of 1AH; used only in vol 285.
#     NOTES - Spit out some notes at the end.
